Good stuff to keep in mind:
Optipon of doing everything throuh Github gives you a template, lets you get started. But you don't have to use any of this stuff.
You can use gh without using gh desktop
You can do it throuhg the command line too if you hate yourself enough
Github templates including the one Wout will later share without having to use gh
If it's not publically availabke, reflect on this in report
Build own website in gh without using wout's stuff if you want
